Assumption :- Graph is directed.

Note :- edge(2,3) in 2016csb1124.pl means there is a directed edge from 2 to 3.
	In output, if path of length p doesn't exist between X and Y, output will be false along with some numbers.
	And if path exists, intermediate nodes are printed on each line.
	For eg : suppose there is a path 1 -> 2 -> 3 , query path(1,3,2) will give 2 as output. 

Querying :-  For checking path of length p from X to Y, write the query path(X,Y,p) and after the output enter dot(.)
	     For checking cycle at node X, write cycle(X) and again enter dot after the first output.
